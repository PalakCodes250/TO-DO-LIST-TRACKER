PROBLEM STATEMENT
Today's hectic lives make it difficult for many people to keep track of their tasks and deadlines, and ignore prioritization altogether. When we no longer can keep things organized, we might forget or successfully avoid doing key important tasks, which limits productivity and will increase your stress levels. In order to continue our productivity levels, we need a simple, efficient, and easy-to-use, easy-to-implement way to track tasks and related deadlines and then, let's categorize them. Ideally, we'd want a way to further reference the same task list in order to see the current completion status of a task when it's due, and when it is going to be due, so we can proactively monitor or set up a plan before it is completed. This project will be focused on programming a console-based To-Do List Manager in Python which allows the user to create, view, edit, delete, and modify tasks. Each task should consist of a due date and when they are completed in addition to category or task type and task priority. This basic system will also record updates about completed tasks, pending tasks, and overdue tasks. The program should be user-friendly, user-interface driven, menu-based, and provide some sort of tracking capabilities for the task list. Once the task list is updated, the tasks shall store the task list in a text file so the user can retrieve the task list and review or contribute to the task manager. This is suppose to address time management and organization.

 
Scope Of the Project
The To-Do List Manager Project entails the implementation of a console-based application for task management that will assist users in planning their daily activities. The scope pertains to the creation of a very simple interface that allows the user to enter tasks to manage, including a due date, priority, and category. The application also includes adding the ability to view, update, delete, and complete tasks. The application will have a reminder functionality system for tasks that are due or overdue to help users remain aware of some deadlines. Another aspect of the project is to include a summary of the open tasks for the user to see what was completed and what is still open. The scope also covers file handling so users can save their task list for their application to work with upon launch. The project focuses on fundamental concepts such as lists, loops, string processing, and input and output working with the console. As part of the scope, more advanced features, such as cloud storage capabilities, a GUI, mobile capabilities, or a multi-user system will not be included.
